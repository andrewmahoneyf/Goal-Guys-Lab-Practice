# INFO 343 Final Project- STAY INFORMED
## After cloning our repository, to run the program make sure you npm install, all packages should be included in dependencies. Once you run npm start you will be able to see a live demo of the site on a local host. 

This folder contains code for the Goal Guys final project for Info 343 Client-Side Web-Development, a valueble web-site for learning about elected officials and laws in America. After the recent election, voter turnout was poor and there was a lot of unease with the results. Our team created this site as a way to educate voters on current officials as well as laws and bills. We want to make sure every voter has easy access to this information in order to make a positive difference in future elections. We believe that by showing people how their government really works, we will increase voter awareness and get people to really care about their election decisions. It is also imperative that this information is easily accessible to every American citizen so we made the website clearly translatable by selecting a language in the header.  

Our team consists of four Undergraduate students at the University of Washington who met in INFO 343 Client-Side Web Development. Our names are Andrew, Non, Ryan and Darryl and we are studying Informatics in order to advance our programing and web-development skills to prepare us for the tech industry. This project is our first together and acts as our final for INFO 343. If you want to learn more about us or have any questions, please feel free to contact us below!
