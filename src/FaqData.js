    {q: 'Why should I know my 4th Amendment rights?', a: 'Everyone should be trained to assert their constitutional rights under the 4th Amendment in order to avoid the hassle and humiliation of police misconduct and illegal searches.'},
    {q: "Doesn't the Fourth Amendment protect me from being searched?", a: 'No. The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of people to be free from unreasonable searches and violations of privacy. The Fourth Amendment states, "The right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized." To determine what might be unreasonable, a "legitimate expectation of privacy" must be established.'},
    {q: 'Why do police want to search me?', a: 'Simply put, the number of arrests an officer makes is a major factor used to determine his job performance. Police officers know that the easiest way to make arrests is to find people in possession of illegal drugs, so they want to search everyone they can find.'},
    {q: 'When are police legally allowed to search me?', a: 'As a general rule, searches conducted without a valid search warrant signed by a judge violate the Fourth Amendment, but like most rules of law, there are a number of explicit exceptions. In fact, most searches occur without warrants because police take advantage of these exceptions to the Fourth Amendment.'},
    {q: "If I'm not doing anything illegal, why shouldn't I let the police search me?", a: 'The sad fact is that most people believe that they are under some kind of obligation to acquiesce when an officer contacts them and asks permission to search them or their belongings.'},
    {q: "Isn't refusing to let the police search me an admission of guilt?", a: "No. If a police officer asks your permission to search, you are under no obligation to consent. The main reason why officers ask is because they don't have enough evidence to search without your consent. Don't expect an officer to tell you of your right not to consent. Any time you consent to a search request you are naively waiving your constitutional rights."},
    {q: "What if the officer says he'll go easy on me if I cooperate?", a: "Unfortunately, many people get fooled by some version of this commonly used police officer's line: 'Everything will be easier if you just cooperate'. That's true to some extent -- it will make things much easier for the police officer who's trying to arrest you! -- but when it comes to you consenting to searches and answering incriminating questions, it couldn't be further from the truth."},
    {q: "Can someone else consent to a search of my property?", a: "This is one of those 'it depends on the circumstances' questions. Police can obtain consent to search from anyone with control over the property; however any occupant of a residence can refuse consent, even if other occupants agree to a search. Unfortunately, you must be present in order to assert your refusal."},
    {q: "The police are at my door. What should I do?", a: "Don't be intimidated by police at your door. These rules will help protect your rights and improve your odds of avoiding a home search."},
    {q: "I refused a search, but the police searched me anyway... Was it an illegal search? What should I do?", a: "Unfortunately, police may sometimes search you even if you refuse consent. If they find anything illegal, you'll have to get a lawyer and fight it out in court, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the search will hold up."},
    {q: "You recommend never lying to police, but what if they ask if I have illegal items and I do? Should I admit to having illegal items? Should I lie?", a: "This is a tricky situation. Of course you should never admit to having illegal items, but you also should make every effort to avoid lying to police. You're always free to remain silent, and police may not hold your silence against you as evidence of wrong-doing (especially if you assert your rights with confidence)."},
    {q: "Are police allowed to lie?", a: "Yes. Police can, will, and often do lie -- especially if it helps them make arrests. The rules regarding entrapment usually tip in favor of law-enforcement, so police won't hesitate to trick you into incriminating yourself or others."},
    {q: "What is reasonable suspicion?", a: "Reasonable suspicion is the legal standard by which a police officer has the right to briefly detain a suspect for investigatory purposes and frisk the outside of their clothing for weapons. Though it does not require hard evidence, it does require more than just a hunch."},
    {q: "If police have a search warrant, do they have to show it to me?", a: "No. The Supreme Court has never ruled that police must present the warrant when performing a search."},
    {q: "Evidence was illegally taken from my home without a search warrant. Isn't this illegal? Will the case against me be dismissed?", a: "Possibly. If a judge decides the evidence was gathered improperly, it may not be allowed into evidence. However, there are many legal loopholes that may allow the evidence to be admitted anyway, and the prosecutor may still be able to effectively try the case even without the evidence."},
    {q: "Can I sue the police department for false arrest and wrongful imprisonment?", a: "An officer who detains an individual without just cause, depriving an individual of his or her freedom without sufficient reason or authority, can potentially be sued along with the police department."},
    {q: "I was asked to come to the police station regarding an incident. I went, answered their questions and then left. Will this show up on my record as an arrest?", a: "No. Charges were not filed and you were not booked. However, if, at a later date, the police determine that there is cause to file charges, you could still be arrested."},
    {q: "My friend has been arrested. Now he's being told he has an arraignment and a preliminary hearing. Aren't these the same thing? When can he get out of jail?", a: "No, they are not the same. At the arraignment, your friend will appear before a judge who will tell him, officially, of the charges. The preliminary hearing is more about the prosecutor. It's when they must establish that there is reasonable grounds to proceed to trial against your friend."},
    {q: "Why do some people have to post bond to get out of jail and others don't?", a: "The purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused will return to court for trial, and the judge will make a determination as to what amount of bail is appropriate based on a number of different factors."},
    {q: "What's the difference between being arrested and being detained?", a: '"Arrested" means you have been taken into custody and can not leave. You can be "detained" for a short period of time if a police officer or other person believes you may be involved in a crime. In either case, you should assert your 5th Amendment right to remain silent and speak to an attorney before saying anything to the police.'},
    {q: "If I don't want to say anything after being arrested I'm within my rights, correct?", a: 'Yes. If you have been arrested, you need only say, "I want to speak with an attorney" or "I have nothing to say now." You do not have to say anything after that.'},
    {q: "I've been arrested. When do I get to make my call?", a: "After being booked, you'll be able to make local phone calls (generally up to three). Booking includes your arrest being written into official police records, fingerprinting and being photographed."},
    {q: "Can I be arrested for videotaping or photographing police?", a: "Videotaping or photographing police in public places is usually legal, so long as you don't interfere with their activities. Nonetheless, doing so will often get you arrested."},
    {q: "When do I have to show ID?", a: "This is a tricky issue. The simple answer is that citizens who are minding their own business are not obligated to show their papers to police. In fact, there is no law requiring citizens to carry identification of any kind. Once you get passed the surface, however, things get much more complicated."},
    {q: "When can police order me out of a car?", a: "During a legitimate traffic stop, police may order the driver and any passengers out of the vehicle. This rule is intended to protect officers' safety, but it's often used for investigatory purposes."},
    {q: "When can police search my car?", a: "While police generally need a warrant to search you or your property, during a traffic stop police only need probable cause to legally search your vehicle. Probable cause means police must have some facts or evidence to believe you're involved in criminal activity."},
    {q: "What are the rights of passengers during traffic stops?", a: "Traffic stops typically occur as a result of suspected moving violations committed by the driver of the vehicle. Passengers cannot be held responsible for the driver's conduct and are generally free to leave, unless police become suspicious of them during the course of the stop. Unfortunately, this happens frequently and the amount of evidence required to detain passengers is minimal."},
    {q: "What if police say they smell marijuana?", a: "If police say they smell marijuana coming from your vehicle, you're in a tough situation. Courts have ruled that the odor of contraband gives officers probable cause to perform a search. For this reason, police are quick to claim that they smell something and sometimes they might even lie about it."},
    {q: "When can police use drug sniffing dogs?", a: "Your rights do not disappear if the officer threatens to call in the dogs, so don't let this all-too-common tactic intimidate you into consenting to a search. You have several options."},
    {q: "How long can police detain me?", a: "That depends. The answer is as long as it reasonably takes police to conduct the investigation. For example, if you've been stopped for speeding, police can technically only detain you long enough to check your paperwork and write you a speeding ticket. However, if the officer discovers evidence of other criminal activity during the stop, they may legally prolong the investigation. Every police encounter is different and the specific circumstances will always determine what it considered a reasonable detention."},
    {q: "What are my rights regarding DUI?", a: "In addition to compromising your safety and the safety of others, driving drunk is one of the stupidest things you can do, and one of the easiest ways to create overwhelming legal problems for yourself. DUI laws vary from state to state, and they have become increasingly harsh over the years."},
    {q: "Is Know My Rights anti-police?", a: "No. We believe that most police officers are good, hardworking people who are doing a tough job. We need police to safeguard the life, liberty, and property of all people. To do this best, police officers should be trained to serve as peace officers whose goal is to preserve people's constitutional rights. In other words, the number of arrests an officer makes should not be a factor used to determine his job performance. Instead, we believe that performance should be measured by the officer's ability to maintain a safe, peaceful neighborhood and earn the residents' trust."},
    {q: "Aren't you teaching people how to get away with breaking the law?", a: "No. We teach people that they have rights, and that these rights are secured by the principal documents that guarantee our civil liberties -- the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. An informed individual who invokes his constitutional protections is doing exactly what our nation's founders intended. "},
    {q: "Does the information on this site apply to minors?", a: "Yes. Minors generally have the same rights as adults. For example, minors can refuse searches and decline to answer questions without an attorney present. Nevertheless, minors face unique challenges when attempting to exercise these rights."},
    {q: "What are my rights in a college dorm?", a: "College students suffer from an unfortunate lack of privacy rights in many situations. The university owns the dorm, so school officials can often search rooms at their own discretion. College students still have 4th Amendment rights that apply in other situations."},
    {q: "How do my rights apply during security checks?", a: "Be aware that private security personnel outnumber police officers in the United States by three to one. As a result, you may be more likely to be confronted by a security guard than by a police officer. You must also be aware of the following places where security personnel (governmental or otherwise) are permitted to search you without a warrant."},
    {q: "What are my rights with TSA airport security?", a: "Be aware that Transportation Security Agency (TSA) agents -- which are part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) -- are permitted to search you and your belongings without probable cause or a search warrant any time you pass through a TSA security zone."},
    {q: "Do you have state-specific information on search and seizure rules, etc.?", a: "Generally not. The Bill of Rights protections that matter most during police encounters are mandated by the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, and all states are required to follow them. States can offer more protection of these rights, but not less. "},
